# Customer_Churn Analysis and Prediction

The examination of a company's customer loss rate is known as churn analysis. We perform an exploratory data analysis on a dataset of eCommerce to get some useful insights which will help us identify the characteristics of churned customers.

CUSTOMER CHURN ANALYSIS (E-COMMERCE):

Customer churn is a frequent issue that E-Commerce businesses face. When you’re trying to build a customer base that delivers recurring revenue, you want to ensure that your E-Commerce churn rate is as low as possible.
Churn occurs when customers take their business elsewhere. This is true for both online stores and eCommerce stores that sell subscription boxes. And while no one ever wants to lose a customer, there’s a lot we can learn by examining customer churn rates.

Churn rate varies from business to business. You have to determine your profitability threshold and the acceptable amount of churn you can allow.
It’s widely believed that anything under 5% is a good churn rate for E-Commerce companies. However, that’s not always the case. Some enterprise companies might see churn rates of up to 10% and consider them a success.

What is Churn Analysis?

The examination of a company's customer loss rate is known as churn analysis.
The number of clients who cease shopping at your online store is referred to as E-Commerce churn. The percentage of clients who stop doing business with you over a defined period is known as the churn rate.

Every firm should keep in mind that churn is inevitable; no organization will ever have a churn rate of 0%. Some of the customers you conduct business with will eventually quit visiting your store or cancel their subscription to your E-Commerce service.
It's crucial that your churn rate stays as low as it can and doesn't outpace your growth rate. Customer retention, which is essential for profitability, is at war with churn. Repeat clients are easier to sell to because they have already established a commitment to your company.

Why Churn Analysis?

-Acquiring a new customer is costlier in than retaining an old one.

-Churned customers give less to no revenue.

-The churned customers increase the competitor’s share.

-Churn analysis also helps in determining the operational shortfalls of the company.

-Churn is a key driver of EBITDA margin and an industry-wide challenge. 

After analyzing the characteristics of churned customers, we can formulate a model to predict whether a newly joined customer is going to churn or not, which helps in developing strategies to retain these customers. It’s simply not enough to understand what churn is and the basic science behind it. You have to know your churn rate to derive actionable business intelligence from that data.

If your E-commerce churn rate is low, it means that your marketing activities are positively impacting your target audience. If your churn rate is high, something is happening that’s pushing people away from your product. You need to determine where that deficiency is so that you can fix it.
Thus, Churn Analysis helps in the overall increase in revenue and quality of the company.

Different Churn scenarios:-

Churn can be both Voluntary as well as Involuntary.
 
Voluntary can be due to the following reasons:-

-Poor customer service

-Perceived low value

-Unsatisfied

Involuntary can be due to the following reasons:-

-Difficult purchase process

-Payment failure

What is considered as Churn in E-Commerce?

The following reasons are considered as churn :-

-Regularly declining purchases

-Negative reviews

-Reduction in purchase frequency

-Increase in number of complaints

-NPS (Net Promoter Score) reduction

FINALLY AFTER ANALYSING THE DATA WE GET THE FOLLOWING INSIGHTS:-

1. Customers who are male and single tend to have a high churn rate.
2. Customers who have filed a complaint, are from low tier cities or have a large distance of warehouse from their home also have a high churn rate.
3. Maximum number of customers spend 3 hours on their app with 99.28% of customers spending 2-4 hours on their app.
4. Most of the people use debit card and credit card as their mode of payment with COD(Cash On Delivery) being the least used.
5. Customers with longer Tenure, high cashback amounts or low recency have comparatively lower churn rate.
6. Also people with longer tenure have more cashback amount, which is obvious.

So if we were to create a model to predict whether a new customer is going to churn or not the top 5 features we can use for the model are:

- Tenure

- Cashback Amount

- Distance from Warehouse to home

- Complaint

- Marital Status (Married, Single) and

- Recency
